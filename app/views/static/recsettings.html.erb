			<li>Set all preferred hitters into starting lineup with "If Game".</li>
			<li>Leave all flex (CI, MI, 2B/SS, 1B/3B) or Utility slots empty with "Fill From Bench".  (Do not check the "Leave Empty" box.)</li>
			<li>Leave all positions where you are rotating multiple players (platoon) empty with "Fill From Bench". (Do not check the "Leave Empty" box.)</li>
			<li>Rank your "Bench" in the order in which you want RotoStarter to set your lineup. For example, if you need steals, you should rank any base stealers a little bit higher.</li>

  		<li>RotoStarter will always try to maximize your lineup and try to start someone who is eligible and has a game that day.</li>
  		<li>Every day, RotoStarter will fill your roster from top to bottom in that order. <br>
  			(For example, C > 1B > 2B > 3B > SS > OF > 2B/SS > 1B/3B > Util).</li>
  		<li>RotoStarter will try to fill each position in the following order:</li>
  		<ol type="i">
  			<li>With a player in "Starting Lineup" with "Always Start" (with or without game today)</li>
  			<li> With a player in "Starting Lineup" with "If Game" (with game today)</li>
  			<li> With the highest priority player with a game today (1 > 2 > 3 > 4 > 5)</li>
  		</ol>
  		<li>Remember, you should probably leave a position in your "Starting Lineup" empty if you have multiple options for that slot (like a Util spot).</li>

  	<ol type="a">
  		<li>If a player in the "Starting Lineup" does not have a game or is on the DL, RotoStarter will try to start someone on the "Bench" instead.</li>
  		<li>RotoStarter will bench anyone with a "DL" tag if he is set to "If Game" (unless he is "Always Start").</li>
  		<li>If you set a player to "Always Start", RotoStarter will always start him:</li>
  		<ol type="i">
  			<li>Even if he does NOT have a game</li>
  		 	<li>Even if he is on the DL</li>
  			<li>This setting may not make sense for you, unless you are way ahead of pace in starts at a position.</li>
  		</ol>
  		<li>You probably don't want to use "Never Start" unless you want RotoStarter to completely avoid starting this player. You could lower the player's priority instead so that he is the very last option.</li>
